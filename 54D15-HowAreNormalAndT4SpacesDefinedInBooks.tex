% this is the default PlanetMath preamble.  as your knowledge
% of TeX increases, you will probably want to edit this, but
% it should be fine as is for beginners.

% almost certainly you want these
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

% used for TeXing text within eps files
%\usepackage{psfrag}
% need this for including graphics (\includegraphics)
%\usepackage{graphicx}
% for neatly defining theorems and propositions
%\usepackage{amsthm}
% making logically defined graphics
%%%\usepackage{xypic}

% there are many more packages, add them here as you need them

\begin{document}
A recent discussion on PlanetMath has led me to consider how various
sources define normal and T4 spaces. I limited myself to books, mostly textbooks.
No articles were consulted. 
As will be seen from the table below, there is no agreement on
the question of how to define it. I am not giving precise references
at this time, and may choose to never do that. I think the abbreviated
form may be sufficient for those that seek to check what I have done.
If you want to add something to the table, file a correction.
S refers to the condition that closed sets can be separated by open sets.
The condition S is due to Tietze, according to Alexandroff and Hopf.
Of course, T1 + S is the same as T2 +S.
