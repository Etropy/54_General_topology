\begin{document}
In a topological space $X$, a point $x$ is a \emph{limit point of the sequence} $x_0, x_1, \ldots$ if, for every open set containing $x$, there are finitely many indices such that the corresponding elements of the sequence do not belong to the open set. 

A point $x$ is an \emph{accumulation point of the sequence} $x_0, x_1, \ldots$ if, for every open set containing $x$, there are infinitely many indices such that the corresponding elements of the sequence belong to the open set.

It is worth noting that the set of limit points of a sequence can differ from the set of limit points of the set of elements of the sequence.  Likewise the set of accumulation points of a sequence can differ from the set of accumulation points of the set of elements of the sequence.
