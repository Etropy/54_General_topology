\begin{Theorem}\cite{lang, mukherjea}
%{\bf Theorem} \cite{lang, mukherjea}
Let $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ be a family of topological spaces. 
Then the product space 
 \[\prod_{i\in I}X_i\]
with the product topology is connected if and only if each 
space $X_i$ is connected.  
\end{Theorem}

As is true of most results in topology
involving products,
the forward implication requires the axiom of choice.
