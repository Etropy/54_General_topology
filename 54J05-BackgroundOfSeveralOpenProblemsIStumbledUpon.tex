This lists some problem aroused while I wrote my book ``Algebraic General Topology. Volume 1''.

The draft of the book is now \href{http://www.mathematics21.org/algebraic-general-topology.html}{available online}.

Please first read the book and then collaborate with me in solving the below listed problems.

Theorems to prove:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intersection with a staroid product through its upper sets.
\item Intersecting two staroidal products.
\item Multifuncoid has atomic arguments.
\item Every regular paratopological group is Tychonoff.
\end{itemize}

More related materials:
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct products in a category of funcoids.
\item Compact funcoids.
\item Meta-singular numbers.
\end{itemize}

See the right sidebar of this page ("Attached articles") for the list of problems.

TODO: More information should be put to this page.

See also \href{http://researchtrends.wikia.com/wiki/Cartesian_closed_categories_containing_Top_and_Prox_as_subcategories}{this page}. Depsite of the fact that this page is written by me, I can't remember whether that page notation is compatible with the notation in my book. Please analyse it and make its copy on PlanetMath.
