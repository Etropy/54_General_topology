Consider $f: X \to Y$ a continuous and surjective function and $X$ a compact set. We will prove that $Y$ is also a compact set.

Let $\{V_a\}$ be an open covering of $Y$. By the continuity of $f$ the pre-image by $f$ of any \PMlinkname{open subset}{OpenSubset} of $Y$ will also be an open subset of $X$.
So we have an open covering $\{U_a\}$ of $X$ where $U_a = f^{-1}(V_a)$.

To see this remember, since the continuity of $f$ implies that each $U_a$ is open, all we need to prove is that $\bigcup_a U_a \supset X$.
Consider $x \in X$, we know that since $\{V_a\}$ is a covering of $Y$ that there exists $i$ such that $f(x) \in V_i$ but then by construction $x \in U_i$ and $\{U_a\}$ is indeed an open covering of $X$.

Since $X$ is compact we can consider a finite set of indices $\{a_i\}$ such that $\{U_{a_i}\}$ is a finite open covering of $X$, but then $\{V_{a_i}\}$ will be a finite open covering of $Y$ and it will thus be a compact set.

To see that $\{V_{a_i}\}$ is a covering of $Y$ consider $y \in Y$. By the surjectivity of $f$ there must exist (at least) one $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$ and since $\{U_{a_i}\}$ is a finite covering of $X$, there exists $k$ such that $x \in U_{a_k}$.
But then since $f(U_{a_k}) = V_{a_k}$, we must have that $y \in V_{a_k}$ and  $\{V_{a_i}\}$ is indeed a finite open covering of $Y$.
