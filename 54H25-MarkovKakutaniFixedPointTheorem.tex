{\bf Theorem} [Markov - Kakutani] {\bf -} Let $X$ be a topological vector space and $\mathcal{T}$ a commuting family of continuous linear operators in $X$. Suppose $K$ is a compact convex subset of $X$ such that

\begin{displaymath}
T(K) \subseteq K
\end{displaymath}
for every $T \in \mathcal{T}$. Then there is a point $x_0 \in K$ such that $Tx_0 = x_0$ for all $T \in \mathcal{T}$.
