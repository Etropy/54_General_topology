\begin{document}
The Smirnov metrization theorem establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem reduces questions of metrizability to paracompactness and a local metrizability condition.

\textbf{Definition:}\ A space $X$ is \emph{locally metrizable} if every point $x\in X$ has a neighborhood that is metrizable in the subspace topology.

\textbf{Theorem (Smirnov metrization theorem):}\ A space is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact and locally metrizable.
