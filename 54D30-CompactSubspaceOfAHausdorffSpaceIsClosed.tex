\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space, and $Y$ be a compact subspace of $X$. We prove that $X\setminus Y$ is open, by finding for every point $x \in X \setminus Y$ a neighborhood $U_x$ disjoint from $Y$.

Let $y \in Y$. $x \neq y$, so by the definition of a Hausdorff space, there exist open neighborhoods $U_x^{(y)}$ of $x$ and $V_x^{(y)}$ of $y$ such that $U_x^{(y)} \cap V_x^{(y)} = \emptyset$. Clearly
$$Y \subseteq \bigcup_{y \in Y} V_x^{(y)}$$
but since $Y$ is compact, we can select from these a finite subcover of $Y$
$$Y \subseteq V_x^{(y_1)} \cup \cdots \cup V_x^{(y_n)}$$
Now for every $y \in Y$ there exists $k \in 1...n$ such that $y \in V_x^{(y_k)}$. Since $U_x^{(y_k)}$ and $V_x^{(y_k)}$ are disjoint, $y \not\in U_x^{(y_k)}$, therefore neither is it in the intersection
$$U_x = \bigcap_{j=1}^n U_x^{(y_j)}$$
A finite intersection of open sets is open, hence $U_x$ is a neighborhood of $x$ disjoint from $Y$.
