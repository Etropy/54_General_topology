\begin{document}
A long standing conjecture:

<strong>Conjecture</strong> Every regular paratopological group is Tychonoff.

I propose to formulate and prove a more general statement about funcoids.

It may may involve product of funcoids, such as cross-composition product or not yet well described direct product of continuous funcoids.
