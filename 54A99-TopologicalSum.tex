\begin{document}
Given two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, their \emph{topological sum} is defined 
to be the set $X \coprod Y$ (see the entry \emph{disjoint union}) equipped with 
the finest topology such that the inclusion maps from $X$ and $Y$ into $X \coprod Y$ 
are continuous.  A basis for this topology consists of the union of the set of 
open subsets of $X$ and the set of open subsets of $Y$.
