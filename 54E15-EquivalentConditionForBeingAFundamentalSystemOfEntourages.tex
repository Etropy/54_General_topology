\begin{lemma*}
Let $X$ be a set and let $\BB$ be a nonempty family of subsets of $X\times X$.  Then $\BB$ is a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity on $X$ if and only if it satisfies the following axioms.
\begin{itemize}
\item
(B1) If $S$, $T\in\BB$, then $S\cap T$ contains an element of $\BB$.

\item
(B2) Each element of $\BB$ contains the diagonal $\Delta(X)$.

\item
(B3) For any $S\in\BB$, the inverse relation of $S$ contains an element of $\BB$.

\item
(B4) For any $S\in\BB$, there is an element $T\in\BB$ such that the relational composition $T\circ T$ is contained in $S$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\BB$ is a fundamental system of entourages for a uniformity $\UU$.  Verification of axiom (B2) is immediate, since $\BB\subseteq\UU$ and each entourage is already required to contain the diagonal of $X$.  We will prove that $\BB$ satisfies (B1); the proofs that (B3) and (B4) hold are analogous.

Let $S$, $T$ be entourages in $\BB\subseteq\UU$.  Since $\UU$ is closed under binary intersections, $S\cap T\in\UU$.  By the definition of fundamental system of entourages, since $S\cap T\in\UU$, there exists an entourage $B\in\BB$ such that $B\subseteq S\cap T$.  Thus $\BB$ satisfies axioms (B1) through (B4).

To prove the converse, define a family of subsets of $X\times X$ by
\[
\UU = \{ S \subseteq X\times X \colon B\subseteq S \text{\ for some $B\in\BB$} \}.
\]
By construction, each element of $\UU$ contains an element of $\BB$, so all that remains is to show that $\UU$ is a uniformity.  Suppose $T$ is a subset of $X\times X$ that contains an element $S\in\UU$.  By the definition of $\UU$, there exists some $B\in\BB$ such that $B\subseteq S$.  Since $S\subseteq T$, it follows that $B\subseteq T$, so $T$ satisfies the requirement for membership in $\UU$.  Thus $\UU$ is closed under taking supersets.  The remaining axioms for a uniformity follow directly from the appropriate axioms for the fundamental system of entourages by applying the axiom we have just checked.  Hence $\BB$ is a fundamental system of entourages for a uniformity on $X$.
