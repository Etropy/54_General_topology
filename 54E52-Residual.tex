\begin{document}
A subspace~$A$ of a topological space~$X$ is called {\em residual} (or {\em comeager}) if and only if it is second category and its complement $X\setminus A$ is first category.  Equivalently, a set is residual if and only if it contains a countable intersection of \PMlinkname{open}{OpenSet} dense sets.
