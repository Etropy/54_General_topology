{\bf Definition}
Suppose $X$ is a metric space with a metric $d$, and suppose
$S$ is a subset of $X$. Let $\varepsilon$ be a positive real number.
A subset $N\subset S$ is an $\varepsilon$\emph{-net
for $S$} if, for all $x\in S$, there is an $y\in N$,
such that $d(x,y)<\varepsilon$.

For any $\varepsilon>0$ and $S\subset X$, the set $S$ is trivially an 
$\varepsilon$-net for itself. 

{\bf Theorem} 
Suppose $X$ is a metric space with a metric $d$, and suppose
$S$ is a subset of $X$. Let $\varepsilon$ be a positive real number.
Then $N$ is an $\varepsilon$-net for $S$, if and only if
$$\{ B_\varepsilon(y) \mid y\in N \}$$
is a cover for $S$. (Here $B_\varepsilon(x)$ is
the open ball with center $x$ and radius $\varepsilon$.)

\emph{Proof.} Suppose $N$ is an $\varepsilon$-net for $S$. 
If $x\in S$, there is an $y\in N$ such that $x\in B_\varepsilon(y)$. 
Thus, $x$ is covered by some set in $\{ B_\varepsilon(x) \mid x\in N \}$.
Conversely, suppose $\{ B_\varepsilon(y) \mid y\in N \}$ is
a cover for $S$, and suppose $x\in S$. By assumption,
there is an $y\in N$, such that $x\in B_\varepsilon(y)$.
Hence $d(x,y)<\varepsilon$ with $y\in N$.
$\Box$

{\bf Example}
In $X=\mathbb{R}^2$ with the usual
Cartesian metric, the set
$$ N = \{(a,b) \mid a,b\in \mathbb{Z}Â \}$$
is an $\varepsilon$-net for $X$ assuming that
$\varepsilon> \sqrt{2}/2$. $\Box$
