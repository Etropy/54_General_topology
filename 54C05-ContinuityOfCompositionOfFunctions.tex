All functions in this entry are functions from $\sR$ to $\sR$. 

\textbf{Example 1}
Let $f(x)= 1$ for $x \leq 0$ and $f(x) = 0$ for $x >0$,
let $h(x) = 0$ when $x\in \sQ$ and $1$ when $x$ is irrational,
and let $g(x)=h(f(x))$. Then $g(x)=0$ for all $x\in \sR$, so
 the composition of two discontinuous functions can be
continuous.

\textbf{Example 2}
If $g(x) = h(f(x))$ is continuous for all functions $f$, then $h$ is continuous.
Simply put $f(x)=x$. Same thing for $h$ and $f$.
If $g(x) = h(f(x))$ is continuous for all functions $h$, then $f$ is continuous.
Simply put $h(x)=x$.

\textbf{Example 3}
Suppose $g(x) = h(f(x))$ is continuous and $f$ is continuous. 
Then $h$ does not need to be continuous. For a conterexample, put
 $h(x)=0$ for all $x\neq 0$, and $h(0)=1$, and
$f(x)=1+|x|$. Now $h(f(x))=0$ is continuous, but $h$ is not.

\textbf{Example 4}
Suppose $g(x) = h(f(x))$ is continuous and $h$ is continuous. Then $f$ does not
need to be continuous. For a counterexample, put
$ f(x) = 0$ for all $x\neq 0$, and $f(0)=1$, and
$h(x)=0$ for all $x$. Now $h(f(x))=0$ is continuous, but $f$ is not.
