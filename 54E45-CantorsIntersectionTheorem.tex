\begin{theorem}
Let $K_1\supset K_2\supset K_3 \supset \ldots \supset K_n\supset \ldots$ be a sequence of non-empty, compact subsets of a metric space $X$. Then the intersection $\bigcap_i K_i$ is not empty.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Choose a point $x_i\in K_i$ for every $i=1,2,\ldots$
Since $x_i \in K_i \subset K_1$ is a sequence in a compact set, by Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, there exists a subsequence $x_{i_j}$ which converges to a point $x\in K_1$. Notice, however, that for a fixed index $n$, the sequence $x_{i_j}$ lies in $K_n$ for all $j$ sufficiently large (namely for all $j$ such that $i_j>n$). So one has $x\in K_n$. 
Since this is true for every $n$, the result follows.
\end{proof}
