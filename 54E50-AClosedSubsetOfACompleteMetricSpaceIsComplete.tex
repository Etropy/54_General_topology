\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a complete metric space, and let $Y \subseteq X$ be a closed subset of $X$. Then $Y$ is complete.

{\bf Proof}

Let $\{ y_n \} \subseteq Y$ be a Cauchy sequence in $Y$. Then by the completeness of $X$, $y_n \rightarrow x$ for some $x \in X$. Then every neighborhood of $x$ contains points in $Y$, so $x \in \overline Y = Y$.
