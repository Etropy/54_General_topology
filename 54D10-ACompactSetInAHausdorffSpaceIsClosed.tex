{\bf Theorem.} A compact set in a Hausdorff space is closed.

\emph{Proof.}
Let $A$ be a compact set in a Hausdorff space $X$.
The case when $A$ is empty is trivial, so let us
assume that $A$ is non-empty.
Using \PMlinkname{this theorem}{APointAndACompactSetInAHausdorffSpaceHaveDisjointOpenNeighborhoods}, 
it follows that each point
$y$ in $A^{\comp}$ has a neighborhood $U_y$, which
is disjoint to $A$. (Here, we denote the complement of $A$
by $A^{\comp}$.)
We can therefore write
\begin{eqnarray*}
A^{\comp} &=& \bigcup_{y\in A^{\comp}} U_y.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since an arbitrary union of open sets is open, it follows that $A$ is
closed. $\Box$
