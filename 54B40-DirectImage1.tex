\begin{document}
If $f : X\to Y$ is a continuous map of topological spaces and $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf on $X$,  the {\em direct image} sheaf, $f_*\mathcal{F}$ on $Y$ is defined by

$(f_*\mathcal{F})(V) = \mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(V))$

for open sets $V\subset Y$, with the restriction maps induced from those of $\mathcal{F}$.
