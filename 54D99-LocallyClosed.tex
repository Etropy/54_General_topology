{\bf \PMlinkescapetext{Definition} -} A subset $Y$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be {\bf locally closed} if it is the intersection of an open and a closed subset.

The following result provides some \PMlinkescapetext{equivalent} definitions:

{\bf \PMlinkescapetext{Proposition} -} The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Y$ is locally closed in $X$.
\item Each point in $Y$ has an open neighborhood $U \subseteq X$ such that $U \cap Y$ is closed in $U$ (with the subspace topology).
\item $Y$ is open in its closure $\overline{Y}$ (with the subspace topology).
\end{enumerate}
