\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a topological group. There is a natural uniform structure on $G$ which induces its topology. We define a subset $V$ of the Cartesian product $G \times G$ to be an entourage if and only if it contains a subset of the form
\[ V_N = \{ (x,y) \in G \times G : xy^{-1} \in N \} \]
for some $N$ neighborhood of the identity element. This is called the \emph{right uniformity} of the topological group, with which \PMlinkescapetext{right} multiplication becomes a uniformly continuous map.
The \emph{left uniformity} is defined in a \PMlinkescapetext{similar} fashion, but in general they don't coincide, although they both induce the same topology on $G$.
