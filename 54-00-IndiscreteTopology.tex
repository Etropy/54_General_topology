If $X$ is a set and it is endowed with a topology defined by


$$\tau=\{X,\emptyset\} \label{eq12}$$
then $X$ is said to have the \emph{indiscrete topology}. 

 Furthermore $\tau$ is the coarsest topology a set can possess, since $\tau$
would be a subset of any other possible topology. This topology
gives $X$ many properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every subset of $X$ is sequentially compact.  
\item Every function to a space with the indiscrete topology is continuous.
\item $X$ is path connected and hence connected but is arc connected only if $X$ is uncountable or if $X$ has at most a single point. However, $X$ is both hyperconnected and ultraconnected. 
\item If $X$ has more than one point, it is not metrizable because it is not Hausdorff. However it is pseudometrizable with the metric $d(x,y)=0$.
\end{itemize}
