\begin{document}
A topological space $X$ is {\em semilocally simply connected} if, for every point $x \in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that the map of fundamental groups
$$
\pi_1(U,x) \longrightarrow \pi_1(X,x)
$$
induced by the inclusion map $U \hookrightarrow X$ is the trivial homomorphism.

A topological space $X$ is connected, locally path connected, and semilocally simply connected if and only if it has a universal cover.
