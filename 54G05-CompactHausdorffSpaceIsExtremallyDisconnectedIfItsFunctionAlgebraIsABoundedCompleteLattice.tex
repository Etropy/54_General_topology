\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $C(X)$ the algebra of continuous functions $X \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Recall that $C(X)$ is a vector lattice with the usual \PMlinkname{order}{PartialOrder}: $f\leq g \Longleftrightarrow g-f$ takes positive (or zero) values.

$\,$

{\bf Theorem - } If every subset of $C(X)$ that is bounded from above has a least upper bound (i.e. $C(X)$ is a bounded complete lattice), then $X$ is extremally disconnected.
