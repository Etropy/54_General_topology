{\bf Definition}. Let $X$ be a uniform space with uniformity $\mathcal{U}$.  The \emph{uniform proximity}, or \emph{proximity generated by $\mathcal{U}$}, is a binary relation $\mathrel{\delta}$ on the subsets of $X$, given by the formula
$$A\mathrel{\delta}B \qquad \iff \qquad \forall U\in\mathcal{U}:U\cap(A\times B)\neq\emptyset.$$

Correctness of the above proximity is given by the below theorem:

{\bf Theorem}. Proximity generated by a uniformity is a proximity.  In other words, $X$ is a proximity space with proximity $\mathrel{\delta}$.
