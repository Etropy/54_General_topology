By way of contradiction, suppose that no Lebesgue number existed. Then there exists an open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ such that for all $\delta > 0$ there exists an $x \in X$ such that no $U \in \mathcal{U}$ contains $B_\delta(x)$ (the open ball of radius $\delta$ around $x$). Specifically, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, since $1/n > 0$ we can choose an $x_n \in X$ such that no $U \in \mathcal{U}$ contains $B_{1/n}(x_n)$. Now, $X$ is compact so there exists a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ of the sequence of points $(x_n)$ that converges to
some $y \in X$. Also, $\mathcal{U}$ being an open cover of $X$ implies that there exists $\lambda > 0$ and $U \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $B_\lambda(y) \subseteq U$. Since the sequence $(x_{n_k})$ converges to $y$, for $k$ large enough it is true that $d(x_{n_k},y) < \lambda/2$ ($d$ is the metric on $X$) and $1/n_k < \lambda/2$. Thus after an application of the triangle inequality, it follows that
\begin{displaymath}
	B_{1/n_k}(x_{n_k}) \subseteq B_\lambda(y) \subseteq U,
\end{displaymath}
contradicting the assumption that no $U \in \mathcal{U}$ contains $B_{1/n}(x_n)$. Hence a Lebesgue number for $\mathcal{U}$ does exist.
