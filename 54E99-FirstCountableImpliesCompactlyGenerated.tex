\begin{prop} Any first countable topological space is compactly generated. \end{prop}
\begin{proof}  Suppose $X$ is first countable, and $A\subseteq X$ has the property that, if $C$ is any compact set in $X$, the set $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$.  We want to show tht $A$ is closed in $X$.  Since $X$ is first countable, this is equivalent to showing that any sequence $(x_i)$ in $A$ converging to $x$ implies that $x\in A$.  Let $C=\lbrace x_i \mid i=1,2,\ldots\rbrace \cup \lbrace x\rbrace$.  

\begin{lem} $C$ is compact. \end{lem} 
\begin{proof} Let $\lbrace U_j\mid j \in J\rbrace$ be a collection of open sets covering $C$.  So $x\in U_j$ for some $j$.  Since $U_j$ is open, there is a positive integer $k$ such that $x_i\in U_j$ for all $i\ge k$.  Now, each $x_i \in U_{d(i)}$ for $i=1,\ldots, k$.  So $C$ is covered by $U_{d(1)}, \ldots, U_{d(k)}$, and $U_j$, showing that $C$ is compact.  
\end{proof}

In addition, as a subspace of $X$, $C$ is also first countable.  By assumption, $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$.  Since $x_i\in A\cap C$ for all $i\ge 1$, we see that $x\in A\cap C$ as well, since $C$ is first countable.  Hence $x\in A$, and $A$ is closed in $X$.
\end{proof}
