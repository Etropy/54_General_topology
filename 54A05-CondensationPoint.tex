Let $X$ be a topological space and $A\subset X$. A point $x\in X$ is called a {\em condensation point} of $A$ if every open neighbourhood of $x$ contains \emph{uncountably} many points of $A$.

For example, if $X=\mathbb R$ and $A$ any subset, then any accumulation point of $A$ is automatically a condensation point. But if $X=\mathbb Q$ and $A$ any subset, then $A$ does not have any condensation points at all. 

We have further classifications of {\em condensation point} where the topological space is an ordered field. Namely,
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em unilateral condensation point:} $x$ is a condensation point of $A$ and there is a positive $\epsilon$ with either $(x-\epsilon,x)\cap A$ countable or $(x,x+\epsilon)\cap A$ countable.
\item {\em bilateral condensation point:} For all $\epsilon>0$, we have both $(x-\epsilon,x)\cap A$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)\cap A$ uncountable.


If $\kappa$ is any cardinal (i.e. an ordinal which is the least among all ordinals of the same cardinality as itself), then a $\kappa$-condensation point can be defined similarly. 
\end{enumerate}
