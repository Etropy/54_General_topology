We list the following commonly quoted properties of compact topological spaces.


\begin{itemize}
\item A closed subset of a compact space is compact
\item A compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed
\item The continuous image of a compact space is compact
\item Compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness in the metric topology
\end{itemize}
