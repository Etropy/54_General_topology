\begin{document}
A set is called \textit{perfect} if it is equal to the set of its limit points. An non-trivial example of a perfect set is the \PMlinkid{middle-thirds Cantor set}{2083}. In fact a more general class of sets is referred to as Cantor sets, which all have (among others) the property of being perfect.
