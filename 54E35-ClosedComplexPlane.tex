\begin{document}
The complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, i.e. the set of the complex numbers $z$ satisfying
$$|z| < \infty,$$
is open but not closed, since it doesn't contain the accumulation points of all sets of complex numbers, for example of the set $\{1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\}$.\, One can \PMlinkescapetext{supplement} $\mathbb{C}$ to the {\em closed complex plane} $\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ by adding to $\mathbb{C}$ the infinite point $\infty$ which \PMlinkescapetext{represents} the lacking accumulation points.  One settles that\, $|\infty| = \infty$,\, where the latter $\infty$ means the real infinity.

The resulting space is the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{C}$. The open sets are the open sets in $\mathbb{C}$ together with sets containing $\infty$ whose complement is compact in $\mathbb{C}$. Conceptually, one thinks of the additional open sets as those open sets ``around $\infty$''.

The one-point compactification of $\mathbb{C}$ is also the complex projective line $\mathbb{CP}^1$, as well as the Riemann sphere.
