\PMlinkescapeword{axiom}

Say $X$ is a \PMlinkid{$T_1$}{1852} topological space.  Let's show that $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x\in X$:

The \PMlinkname{$T_1$ axiom}{T1Space} gives us, for every $y$ distinct from $x$, an open $U_y$ that contains $y$ but not $x$.  Since we're in a topological space, we can take the union of all these open sets to get a new open set,

\[U=\bigcup_{y\neq x} U_y .\]

$\{x\}$ is the complement of $U$, closed because $U$ is open: None of the $U_y$ contain $x$, so $U$ doesn't contain $x$.  But any $y\neq x$ is in $U$, since $y\in U_y\subset U$.  That takes care of that.

Now let's say we have a topological space $X$ in which $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x\in X$.  We'd like to show that $T_1$ holds:

Given $x\neq y$, we want to find an open set that contains $x$ but not $y$.  $\{y\}$ is closed by hypothesis, so its complement is open, and our search is over.
