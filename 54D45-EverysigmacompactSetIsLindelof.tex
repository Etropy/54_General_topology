\begin{thm} Every \PMlinkname{$\sigma$-compact}{SigmaCompact} set is Lindel\"of (every open cover has a
countable subcover). 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be a $\sigma$-compact. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an open cover of
$X$ . Since $X$ is $\sigma$-compact, it is the union of countable
many compact sets, $$X = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}X_{i}$$ with $X_{i}$
compact. Consider the cover
$\mathcal{A}_{i}=\left\{A\in\mathcal{A}: X_{i}\cap A \neq \emptyset
\right\}$ of the set $X_{i}$. This cover is well defined, it is not empty and covers $X_{i}$: for each $x \in X_{i}$ there is at least one of the open sets $A\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $x \in A$.

Since $X_{i}$ is compact, the cover
$\mathcal{A}_{i}$ has a finite subcover. Then $$X_{i}\subseteq
\bigcup_{j=0}^{N_j}A_{i}^{j}$$ and thus $$X\subseteq \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}
\left(\bigcup_{j=0}^{N_j}A_{i}^{j}\right).$$ That is, the set
$\left\{A_{i}^{j} \right\}$ is a countable subcover of $\mathcal{A}$
that covers $X$.
