{\bf Theorem} Suppose $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is a collection of
Hausdorff spaces. Then the
 generalized Cartesian product
 $ \prod_{\alpha\in A} X_\alpha $
equipped with the product topology is a Hausdorff space.

\emph{Proof.} Let $Y=\prod_{\alpha\in A} X_\alpha$, and
let $x,y$ be distinct points in $Y$. Then there is an index $\beta \in A$
such that $x(\beta)$ and $y(\beta)$ are distinct points in
the Hausdorff space $X_\beta$. It follows that there are open sets
$U$ and $V$ in $X_\beta$ such that $x(\beta)\in U$, $y(\beta) \in V$,
and $U\cap V = \emptyset$.
Let $\pi_\beta$ be the projection operator $Y\to X_\beta$ defined
\PMlinkname{here}{GeneralizedCartesianProduct}. By the definition of
the product topology, $\pi_\beta$ is continuous, so
$\pi_\beta^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi_\beta^{-1}(V)$ are open sets in $Y$. Also,
since the 
\PMlinkname{preimage commutes with set operations}{InverseImageCommutesWithSetOperations}, 
we have that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pi_\beta^{-1}(U) \cap \pi_\beta^{-1}(V) &=& \pi_\beta^{-1} \big(U \cap V\big) \\
 &=& \emptyset.
\end{eqnarray*}
Finally, since $x(\beta)\in U$, i.e., $\pi_\beta(x)\in U$,
it follows
that $x\in \pi_\beta^{-1}(U)$. Similarly,  $y\in \pi_\beta^{-1}(V)$.
We have shown that $U$ and $V$ are open disjoint neighborhoods of
$x$ respectively $y$. In other words, $Y$ is a Hausdorff space.
