A topological space $X$ is {\em locally connected} at a point $x \in X$ if every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$. The space $X$ is {\em locally connected} if it is locally connected at every point $x \in X$.

A topological space $X$ is {\em locally path connected} at a point $x \in X$ if every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a path connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$. The space $X$ is {\em locally path connected} if it is locally path connected at every point $x \in X$.
