\section{Definition}

The notion of \emph{metric space} may be defined in a way which makes use only of rational numbers as opposed to real numbers.  To avoid mention of real numbers we take a three place relation as our primitive term instead of the distance function.  Thus, one can use this definition to define the set of real numbers as the completion of the set of rational numbers as a metric space.  Let $\mathbb{Q}_+$ denote the set of strictly positive rational numbers

\begin{definition}
A \emph{metric space} consists of a set $X$ and a relation $D \subset X \times X \times \mathbb{Q}_+$ which satisfies 
the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For all $x,y \in X$, it is the case that $D(x,y,r)$ for all $r \in \mathbb{Q}_+$ if and only if $x = y$.
\item  For all $x,y \in X$ and all $r \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, it is the case that $D(x,y,r)$ if and only if $D(y,x,r)$.
\item For all $x,y \in X$ and all $r,s \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, if $r \le s$ and $D(x,y,r)$ then $D(x,y,s)$.
\item For all $x,y,z \in X$ and all $r,s \in \mathbb{Q}_+$, if $D(x,y,r)$ and $D(y,z,s)$, then $D(x,z,r+s)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{Equivalence with usual definition}

The definition presented above is equivalent to the definition presented in 
\PMlinkname{metric space}{MetricSpace}.
This equivalence is 
given by the following equations which relate the primitive term ``$D$'' used in this definition with the primitive 
term ``$d$'' of the previous definition:
 \[ d(x,y) = \inf \{r \mid D(x,y,r) \} \]
 \[ D(x,y,r) \leftrightarrow d(x,y) \le r \]
