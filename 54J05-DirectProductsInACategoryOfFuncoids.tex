ADDED: I've proved that subatomic product is the categorical product.

There are defined (\href{http://www.mathematics21.org/algebraic-general-topology.html}{see my book}) several kinds of product of (any possibly infinite number) funcoids:

\begin{enumerate}
\item cross-composition product
\item subatomic product
\item displaced product
\end{enumerate}

There is one more kind of product, for which it is not proved that the product of funcoids are (pointfree) funcoids:

$$\left\langle f_1 \times f_2 \right\rangle x = \bigsqcup \left\{ \left\langle
f_1 \right\rangle X \times^{\mathsf{\operatorname{FCD}}} \left\langle f_2
\right\rangle X \hspace{1em} | \hspace{1em} X \in \operatorname{atoms} x \right\}.$$

It is considered natural by analogy with the category {\bf Top} of topological spaces to consider this category:

\begin{itemize}
\item Objects are endofuncoids on small sets.
\item Morphisms between a endofuncoids $\mu$ and $\nu$ are continuous (that is corresponding to a continuous funcoid) functions from the object of $\mu$ to the object of $\nu$.
\item Composition is induced by composition of functions.
\end{itemize}

It is trivial to show that the above is really a category.

The product of functions is the same as in {\bf Set}.
