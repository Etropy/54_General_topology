\begin{document}
The set of topologies which can be defined on a set is partially ordered under inclusion.  Below, we list several synonymous terms which are used to refer to this order.  Let $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ be two topologies defined on a set $E$.  All of the following expressions mean that $\mathcal{U} \subset \mathcal{V}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{U}$ is \textbf{weaker} than $\mathcal{V}$
\item $\mathcal{U}$ is \textbf{coarser} than $\mathcal{V}$
\item $\mathcal{V}$ is \textbf{finer} than $\mathcal{U}$
\item $\mathcal{V}$ is a \textbf{refinement} of $\mathcal{U}$
\item $\mathcal{V}$ is an \textbf{expansion} of $\mathcal{U}$
\end{itemize}

It is worth noting that this condition is equivalent to the requirement that  the identity map from $(E, \mathcal{V})$ to $(E, \mathcal{U})$ is continuous.
